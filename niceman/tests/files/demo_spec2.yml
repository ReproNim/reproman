#
# A "distribution" is a source for a number of packages. Here we define configuration
# details for various distributions. We'll probably have some built-in types that
# require no configuration, such as "pip".
#

distributions:
 #
 # We'll have both generic distribution types (like "apt") and specific types that we know
 # special details about (like "Debian" and "NeuroDebian"). Specifically, for Debian and 
 # NeuroDebian, we will already know how to retrieve specific snapshots in time.

 - name: NeuroDebian-1
   type: NeuroDebian
   source-type: deb

 # If niceman isn't familiar with the source's distribution, just record the 
 # sources.list information

#
# Once we have sources, we can then state where packages come from.
#

packages:
 #
 # For apt, we need to use "dpkg -s" to get installed information
 # We use "apt-cache show" to get the MD5sum (if available)
 # "apt-cache showpkg" to get repository information for installed package
 # We can use the date of /var/lib/dpkg/info/PACKAGE.list to get the install date:
 #  "stat -c %y /var/lib/dpkg/info/fslview.list"
 #
 # From "(/var/lib/apt/lists/neuro.debian.net_debian_dists_xenial_main_binary-amd64_Packages)"
 # we'd have to glean the right source
 # 
 # For "xterm" I have a version (297-1ubuntu1) that is older than the current one
 # (322-1ubuntu1). For this reason we can't get the MD5sum or the size from "apt-cache show".
 # And we have to guess the distribution using the information from the newest version
 # using "apt-cache showpkg"
 #

 # 
 # For "fslview" we do have the latest version, so I gcan get the filename, size, and
 # hash information.
