    - Whenever we allow for some "hypothetical" ownership, /a/b/c/d/f with
      git at /a/b and hg at /a/b/c/ it must be hg repo which contains it.
      But may be we wouldn't need that and should just grab all the repositories

      above files which were not found belonging to any -- that is where we
      could go with the most nested one and include it as well, although without
      assigning any file specifically to it
    - CVS and svn might be the first ones to consider since they have corresponding
      .svn and CVS at every level in their hierarchy so easier to catch

    Assumptions:
    - VCS operate at the "directories" level, i.e. the file /a/b/c can't be contained
